            <p> I have tried myself in different languages of programing. I spend most of the time upgrading skills in
                C++ and that`s the main language on which I code. Also I gained basic skills on the first grade of University
                self-studying in Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Thanks to the CS50`courses had experience working with C
                as well as with SQL.

                    Mechanics and Mathematics, Professor I.I. Liashko were its founders. Almost at once after the
                    establishment, Faculty of Cybernetics became a major center of training specialists in the area of
                    applied mathematics and informatics in the Soviet Union.</p>

                     <p>   Nowadays Faculty of Computer Science and Cybernetics consists of 9 departments: computational
                         mathematics, complex systems modeling, operations research, theoretical cybernetics, theory
                         and technology of programming, mathematical informatics, system analysis and theory of
                         decision making, applied statistics and information systems.</p>

                     <p>For today Faculty of Computer Science and Cybernetics is the one of the biggest faculties
                         in the University, which provides training of the bachelors, masters and doctoral students.</p>
